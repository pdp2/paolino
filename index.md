## Welcome to my new website

The idea for this blog is to explore things I am interested in, but also to document the process of building this website. I would like to provide links to specific git commits so the website can be viewed at different points in time. That was part of the reason I was looking to use a static site generator (SSG) to build this website. I'm trying out [Lume](https://lume.land/), which is a static site generator for Deno. I was keen to explore Deno a bit more too because I was interested in the fact it doesn't require a node modules folder and it also offers additional security features that prevent network and file storage access by default. So here it goes! In the next post I am thinking of writing about how I went about setting up this site so far.
